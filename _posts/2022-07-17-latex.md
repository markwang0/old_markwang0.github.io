### tl;dr <a name="tldr"></a>
---
Use the VS Code extension [LaTeX-Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) to set up a local LaTeX environment that resembles Overleaf. You will need a local installation of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). Read on for a more detailed guide of how to set this up.

### Purpose of this post <a name="purpose"></a>
---
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a great online tool for editing and compiling LaTeX documents. It has useful [collaboration features](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Can_multiple_authors_edit_the_same_file_at_the_same_time%3F) and a surprisingly robust [free tier membership](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans). However, Overleaf needs an internet connection to compile your documents. Additionally, several useful features are not available in the free tier membership:

<ul>
    <li>git integration</li>
    <li>cloud drive sync</li>
    <li>longer compile time allocations</li>
</ul>

I have always wanted to have a local LaTeX environment so I could work offline, have free git integration, and enjoy unlimited compile time. This would also simplify syncing with a cloud drive. However, the time required to get LaTeX working offline did not seem to justify the effort to me, especially when Overleaf has such a convenient environment ready to go.[^1]

Recently I switched to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor of choice and have been exploring the extensions that it has available. I found the extension [LaTeX-Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) to offer exactly what I was looking for: a local LaTeX environment with comparable convenience to Overleaf. If you're interested in switching from Overleaf to VS Code, hopefully this post is helpful.

[^1]: I tried [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) but didn't love its UI.

### Installing TeX Live <a name="insttex"></a>
---
These instructions are adapted from LaTeX-Workshop's [excellent wiki](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#installation).

In order to use LaTeX-Workshop you must first have a local installation of TeX Live. The TeX Live [quick install](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html) worked fine on my M1 Macbook Pro.  The steps I followed to install from the terminal are below. The quick install page also has directions if you are using Linux or Windows or prefer a GUI installer.

**Note:** the last command downloads over 7 GB onto your computer. Using the `--scheme=small` flag results in a smaller installation but does not have all of the features required by LaTeX-Workshop out of the box.

```console
$ cd /tmp # or wherever you prefer
$ wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz # uncompress the tarball
$ cd install-tl-* # uncompressed directory's name ends with today's YYYYMMDD date
$ sudo perl ./install-tl --paper=letter --scheme=full --no-interaction # install
```

The installation step took about two hours for me with a relatively slow internet connection. After installing I received this warning:

```
*** PLEASE READ THIS WARNING ***********************************

The following (inessential) packages failed to install properly:

  skills

You can fix this by running this command:
  tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed
to complete the installation.

However, if the problem was a failure to download (by far the
most common cause), check that you can connect to the chosen mirror
in a browser; you may need to specify a mirror explicitly.
******************************************************************
```

Which I resolved with this command:

```console
$ sudo tlmgr update --all --reinstall-forcibly-removed option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
```

Finally, I added the path to TeX Live's executables to my PATH environment variable. The installer will print out the path to add after a successful installation. For me this was `/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin`. If you are unsure how to edit your PATH environment variable, a quick Google search should do the trick. I use `zsh`, so I added the line 

```zsh
export PATH="/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin:$PATH"
```

to my `~/.zshrc` configuration file.

### Installing LaTeX-Workshop<a name="instlat"></a>
---
This part is easy. Use [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) or search for the "LaTeX-Workshop" extension in VS Code.

### Using LaTeX-Workshop <a name="uselat"></a>
---
LaTeX-Workshop just worked for me after updating my PATH environment variable. If you update your PATH and are still having trouble, check out [possible solutions from the wiki](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#setting-path-environment-variable).

Download one of your Overleaf projects from Overleaf's website, unzip, and open up the main `.tex` file with VS Code. If you don't have a LaTeX project to use, feel free to try out my CV which is [on GitHub](https://github.com/markwang0/cv). Then, you can build/compile your document by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd> on Windows). To bring up the PDF viewer, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> on Windows).

At this point, you can compile your documents in VS Code. In the next section I will share some optional configurations to make LaTeX-Workshop behave more like Overleaf.

### Configuring LaTeX-Workshop <a name="conlat"></a>
---

LaTeX-Workshop with TeX Live worked for me right out of the box. All the packages I needed were included, including some that seem niche like `fontawesome5`. If there is a package that you don't have locally, install it from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network ([CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/search)). You can use the command line tool `tlmgr` included with TeX Live:

```console
$ sudo tlmgr install <package1> <package2> ...
$ sudo tlmgr remove <package1> <package2> ...
```

Check out the [LaTeX Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages) for more info.
