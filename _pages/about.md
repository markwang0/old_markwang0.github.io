Hi, I'm Mark (王凯章).

I'm an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the [Passalacqua Group](https://sites.google.com/site/passalacquagroup) at the University of Texas at Austin.

My research deals with flood inundation mapping and the computational modeling of compound floods, particularly in coastal regions.

I expect to finish my M.S. in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering in May of 2022.

Before graduate school I was a green infrastructure engineer in the private and public sectors as well as a 2019-20 Fulbright Fellow.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
